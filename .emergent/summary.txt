The AI engineer successfully initiated a CRM Kanban SaaS application, prioritizing core features like authentication, Kanban board UI with drag-and-drop, and lead management. The development followed a phased approach, starting with the most valuable components to provide a quick aha moment. Key decisions included using MongoDB for the database, FastAPI for the backend, and React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend. Authentication was implemented using JWT and bcrypt.

After building and verifying the core system through screenshots and manual  tests, the engineer proceeded with integrating Google Calendar, advanced automations, and detailed reports, based on the user's implicit approval (fique a vontade!). Despite an initial failure to invoke the  tool, the engineer directly implemented the Google Calendar integration by adding necessary Python dependencies and modifying backend/frontend code. The last action indicates the completion of these major feature additions. The trajectory shows a systematic approach to development, testing, and incorporating user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The user, a marketing professional, aims to develop a micro-SaaS CRM with a Kanban-style interface. The core problem is to provide a highly simple yet robust system for managing sales funnels, automations, and leads.

**Key Requirements & Implementation Status:**
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented (Cadastro/login via email e senha, JWT, bcrypt). User profiles (Admin, Gerente, Usuário) are established.
*   **Dashboard Kanban:** Implemented (Customizable columns, Drag & drop for leads/tasks). Initial columns: Novo, Qualificado, Proposta, Negociação, Fechado Ganho, Fechado Perdido.
*   **Gestão de Leads/Tarefas:** Implemented (CRUD for cards with name, company, stage, tags, notes, attachments). Creation and viewing of leads are functional. Activity history is planned.
*   **Automação & Notificações:** Initial setup for automations and notifications has been implemented alongside Google Calendar integration. Explicit rules, email notifications, and WhatsApp integration are pending specific rule implementation.
*   **Integrações Externas:** Google Calendar integration has been implemented for scheduling follow-ups and meetings. Webhooks and Meta Ads connector are pending.
*   **Relatórios & Métricas:** Detailed reports and metrics are being implemented as part of the advanced features phase.
*   **Temas & Personalização:** Basic UI is functional. Custom themes (colors, logo, fonts) and dark/light mode are planned.
*   **API & Extensibilidade:** RESTful API is functional for core CRM operations. Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) and specific webhook endpoints are pending.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Front-end:** React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS
-   **Back-end:** Node.js (implicitly Express.js/FastAPI, as FastAPI was used), FastAPI framework
-   **Database:** MongoDB (via Motor ODM)
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt for password hashing, Authlib for Google OAuth
-   **Python Libraries:** , , , , 
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



**File Summaries:**

*   ****
    *   **Importance:** This is the core of the backend application, defining all API endpoints and business logic.
    *   **Changes Made:** Initially, it was rewritten to include FastAPI application setup, MongoDB connection, JWT-based user authentication (registration, login with bcrypt), user role management, and CRUD operations for leads/Kanban cards. More recently, it was updated to incorporate Google Calendar integration and placeholders/logic for advanced automations and reports. It uses environment variables for  and .
*   ****
    *   **Importance:** The main React component rendering the user interface.
    *   **Changes Made:** Initially, it was rewritten to provide a functional and responsive Kanban dashboard, login/registration forms, a modal for creating new leads, and basic styling using Tailwind CSS. It now includes (or will include) UI elements for Google Calendar integration, automations, and reports based on the latest update. It uses  for API calls.
*   ****
    *   **Importance:** Contains global and component-specific styles for the frontend.
    *   **Changes Made:** Rewritten to apply Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom styles for the Kanban board, forms, and general layout to create a professional UI.
*   ****
    *   **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies required for the backend.
    *   **Changes Made:**  was added for password hashing. Subsequently, , , and  were added for Google Calendar integration.
*   ****
    *   **Importance:** Stores environment-specific variables for the backend.
    *   **Changes Made:**  was added for JWT token generation and validation.  is assumed to be present as per system context.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implementing explicit rules for automations (e.g., when move to Proposta, send email X).
-   Integrating WhatsApp notifications (via API/Twilio).
-   Connecting with Meta Ads.
-   Developing detailed reports beyond initial metrics (e.g., ROI per campaign, lead time).
-   Implementing customizable themes (colors, logo, fonts) and dark/light mode.
-   Generating API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger).
-   Setting up Cypress for e2e tests and Jest for unit tests.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a significant phase of development, following the user's permission to proceed with advanced features.
Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **Google Calendar Integration:** The backend () and frontend () have been updated to incorporate Google Calendar functionality, allowing for the scheduling and syncing of events related to leads. This involved installing , , and  in the backend.
2.  **Advanced Automations & Detailed Reports:** The  and  files were also updated to include initial logic and UI elements for these features, although the precise functionality details (e.g., specific automation rules, full report generation) would require further definition and implementation.

The last action performed was writing the updated  and  files using , and subsequently taking a screenshot of the application, presumably to visually confirm the changes.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the newly implemented Google Calendar integration, advanced automations, and reporting features.
